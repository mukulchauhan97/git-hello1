Hello everyone!!

I’m going anonymous for obvious reasons. Sorry for the long answer but hope you get something good 
out of it.

I am reading so many stories about physical abuse, child abuse and rapes which happened among the 
family or friends or in neighborhood.

Since I had faced it, I can tell many of them are true stories. Maybe all of them are true but few 
things are hard to believe. Well this is my point of view which may differ !!

I am a Indian married lady in her early 30’s. Long back when I was 17 slim , wheatish, careless, 
confident girl. Living with my family and few bare minimal dreams of future. There comes a boy of 
my age and lives as a tenant in the neighborhood, to be precise our house has a common wall. Hence 
it was easier for him to jump into my house. My parents were strict but somehow the guy gained the 
trust.
