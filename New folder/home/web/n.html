I am a 21-year-old girl in the final year of my engineering. I am a University Rank holder and 
have always secured the first rank in my class. I am not a healthy girl. I have been diagnosed
 with many ailments during the last 5 years of my life. It has been a struggle and students and
 teachers at college don’t know this about me.

I have been suffering from scalp psoriasis for the past ten years. I spend 2 to 3 hours every day 
cleaning my scalp so that others wouldn’t know I have it. It’s hell doing it every day.
