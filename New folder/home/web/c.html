I have been suffering from scalp psoriasis for the past ten years. I spend 2 to 3 hours every 
day cleaning my scalp so that others wouldn’t know I have it. It’s hell doing it every day.

I was suffering from anaemia in my 1st year of engineering and my haemoglobin dropped to 3.2 
due to loss of blood. I was hospitalised and later was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis which the
 doctor said can never be cured. The medicines the doctor gave had steroids in it to suppress the 
inflammation in my body. This caused acute pancreatitis and I was hospitalised again. After I was 
discharged, the doctor thought of giving me a mild dosage of steroids. I was okay for about three 
days and again was hospitalised due to acute pancreatitis. Eventually, I lost a year due to lack 
of attendance and it shattered me.

I somehow temporarily recovered and joined engineering next year in a better college. One day, my 
hands started aching suddenly and this continued for a few months. I was diagnosed with IBD 
arthritis in my left wrist. And it is still deformed but people can’t notice it. No one knows 
about it in college.
